    """Check that array correctly represents an outcome for survival analysis.

    Parameters
    ----------
    y_or_event : structured array with two fields, or boolean array
        If a structured array, it must contain the binary event indicator
        as first field, and time of event or time of censoring as
        second field. Otherwise, it is assumed that a boolean array
        representing the event indicator is passed.

    *args : list of array-likes
        Any number of array-like objects representing time information.
        Elements that are `None` are passed along in the return value.

    allow_all_censored : bool, optional, default: False
        Whether to allow all events to be censored.

    Returns
    -------
    event : array, shape=[n_samples,], dtype=bool
        Binary event indicator.

    time : array, shape=[n_samples,], dtype=float
        Time of event or censoring.
