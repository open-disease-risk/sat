# DSM: Deep Survival Machines

## Overview

Deep Survival Machines (DSM) is a parametric survival analysis model that uses a mixture of distributions approach to model survival time. It's particularly effective at capturing complex survival distributions and providing uncertainty estimates.

For a full implementation of DSM, refer to the original paper and the SAT implementation in `sat/models/heads/dsm.py`.

For comprehensive documentation on all survival models, see [Models Documentation](models.md).

For a comparison with MENSA and other approaches, see [MENSA Documentation](mensa.md).
