# DeepHit: Deep Learning for Survival Analysis with Competing Risks

## Overview

DeepHit is a deep learning-based approach for survival analysis that excels at handling competing risks scenarios. It uses a discrete-time approach combined with ranking-based loss functions to predict survival probabilities.

For a full implementation of DeepHit, refer to the original paper and the SAT implementation in `sat/models/heads/survival.py` with the DeepHit loss functions.

For comprehensive documentation on all survival models, see [Models Documentation](models.md).

For a comparison with MENSA and other approaches, see [MENSA Documentation](mensa.md).
