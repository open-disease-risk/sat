# SurvRNC Optimization Benchmark Results

This document summarizes the performance comparison between the original SurvRNCLoss implementation and the optimized versions.

## Speedup by Batch Size

The table below shows the average speedup factor for different batch sizes.

| Batch Size | Optimized | Optimized+Mining |
|------------|-----------|------------------|
| 16 | 1.15x | 1.16x |
| 32 | 2.09x | 2.11x |
| 64 | 1.00x | 0.98x |
| 128 | 1.06x | 1.07x |
| 256 | 1.00x | 36.38x |

## Key Findings

- **Average Speedup (Optimized)**: 1.26x faster than the original implementation
- **Average Speedup (Optimized+Mining)**: 8.34x faster than the original implementation
- **Maximum Speedup (Optimized)**: 3.14x faster than the original implementation
- **Maximum Speedup (Optimized+Mining)**: 68.38x faster than the original implementation


## Optimizations Applied

1. **Vectorized Interpolation**: Replaced loop-based interpolation with vectorized operations

2. **Efficient Matrix Operations**: Reduced redundant calculations in similarity matrix computation

3. **Memory Reuse**: Minimized temporary tensor allocations

4. **Hard Negative Mining**: Added optional hard mining for large batch sizes to improve scaling

5. **LogSumExp Optimization**: Improved stability and efficiency of contrast calculations
